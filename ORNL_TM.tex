Recently interest has grown in the ability to model circulating fuel reactors
(CFRs) in all aspects. Kinetics modeling is essential to the evaluation of any
reactor or reactor design and therefore such capability is sought for CFRs.
CFRs present unique challenges to kinetics models developed for solid fuel
reactors; primarily that the delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) are displaced
from their originating positions by the fluid fuel flow and the case that
the flowing fluid fuel tends to cool the moderator if any is present. The
displacement of DNPs strongly couples thermalhydraulics to neutronics in ways
beyond density and doppler related effects. As such it is an open question
of whether or not traditional kinetics models and tools are suitable for
CFR kinetics evaluation. A review article titled \textit{A Review of Molten Salt
Reactor Kinetics Models} by Daniel Wooten and Jeffery Powers is soon to be
published which largely details the current state of kinetics modelling for
CFRs. In this report the author's un-published opinions and tentative findings
are detailed. \textbf{It is assumed that readers will be familiar with the
review article}.

\section{Un-Published Conclusions - Neutronics}
\end{center}

The question of CFR kinetics modelling largely revolves around how much
detail is needed in the modelling of the DNP distribution. Methods shown in
the review article range from no accounting of DNP drift at all to full
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of DNP advective and diffusive movement. Additional degrees
of freedom are introduced in the question of how to account for changing
flow patterns. Is an approximate accounting of DNP drift, using just one
flow pattern, sufficient for all flow patterns, or must each one be treated
individually. Perhaps the most comprehensive analysis of these questions can be
found in \cite{dulla_models_2005} and \cite{dulla_interactions_2007}. With
regards to actual answers the fact of the matter is that no conclusions as to
the suitability of reduced computational cost methods, such as quasi-statics or
variations of point reactor kinetics, can be made for a given system unless
first compared to results provided by time resolved deterministic methods,
either diffusion or transport based, which
include fluid fuel flow effects into the DNP distribution equations. Several
studies in the review article do highlight that fluid fuel flow effects have
negligible impact on the prompt neutron flux and do not need to be incorporated
for accurate modelling. Additionally a parametric study in
\cite{aufiero_development_2014} demonstrates that turbulent diffusion can
largely be ignored from DNP distribution calculations as a 2 order of magnitude
change in the governing parameter produced a 20 pcm shift in reactivity. 
Additionally, as highlighted in \cite{delpech_benchmark_2003}, many models
which do not include DNP turbulent diffusion are easily validated against
MSRE experimental data. To be fair, however, MSRE flow conditions were largely
laminar in the core and turbulent diffusion was not a significant phenomenon.
One conclusion that all authors cited in the review paper agreed upon was that
molecular diffusion of the DNPs was not necessary to model.
\par With regards to suggested directions and methods for CFR kinetics analysis
it is clear that solely relying on deterministic methods is not only overkill
for the problem at hand but is too computationally expensive for reactor
safety analysis. While the speed of point reactor kinetics approaches is
desirable \cite{dulla_models_2005} does show that in transients for which there
are strong perturbations to the flow speed point reactor kinetics models,
even those re-derived in the context of a flowing fluid fuel, may fail to 
accurately capture transient behavior. The conclusions of that study, however,
should be evaluated in light of the fact that both doppler and density effects
on reactivity were neglected in the models used. As such the conclusions are
more pertienent for low power operational conditions rather than accident ones in which
temperature driven effects may damp the importance of the DNP distribution.
 Point reactor kinetic approaches, as
shown in \cite{zhang_comparison_2009}, do model transients well at nominal
operating powers, when the DNP contribution to reactivity is small compared
to thermal effects, and in situations where fluid fuel flows slow to a stop.
This conclusion, that point reactor kinetics models capture well transients in
CFRs at non-zero power levels is supported by other works found in the
review article. This said, these approaches are certainly not appropriate
for all transients. An approach which shows promise for being universally
applicable to CFR transients is quasi-statics. In quasi-statics a deterministic
method is used to update point reactor kinetics parameters on a coarser time
mesh than that used for the point reactor kinetics modelling which is used
in between deterministic time steps. In this way some computational savings
can be realized without much loss in transient accuracy as seen in
\cite{dulla_models_2005} and \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005}.
\par A final note should be made to steady state calculations of CFR
criticality. Those calculations, deterministic or Monte Carlo, which do not
account for DNP drift will overestimate CFR k-eigenvalues to amounts as high
as the static delayed neutron fraction or about 600 pcm in thermal Uranium-235
based systems; though the overestimation is typically much lower at around 
200 pcm.

\section{Un-published Conclusions - Thermalhydraulics}
With regards to the fidelity of thermalhydraulics modelling the conclusions
are less debated. In \cite{dulla_interactions_2007} it is conclusively shown that
even in laminar systems such as the MSRE assuming a flat velocity profile
through the core for the fluid flow velocity leads to non-negligible errors
in transient simulations though it is unlikely that CFD simulations of channel
guided cores are necessary. However, it has been shown in a myriad of papers
that simplistic assumptions for the fluid flow velocity profile in can type
molten salt reactors (MSRs), such as the European Molten Salt Fast Reactor or
the Russian Molten Salt Actinide Transmuter and Recycler, are insufficient for
modelling the kinetics of such systems largely due to naturally occurring flow
structures within the core such as eddies and re-circulation zones. In such
cases CFD modelling of the flows in these cores, throughout a transient, will
likely be required.
