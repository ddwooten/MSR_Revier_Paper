\section{Itroduction} \label{introduction}
Standard stuff about MSRs.

\section{Unique Physics of Circulating Fuel} \lable{physics}
In comparison to solid fuel reactors circulating fuel reactors exhibit unique
physics which affect all aspects of reactor kinetics. In the following
sub-sections the key phenomonon unique to the kinetics of circulating fuel
reactors are elaborated upon.

\subsection{Neutron Flux} \lable{flux}
While the speed of neutrons, fast or thermal, is typically many order of magnitude greater than
the flow velocity of the fluid fuel the neutron flux can still experience
perturbations due to this fluid velocity field. These perturbations are always
due to second order effects; generally related to changes in fluid temperature
and distributions of delayed neutron precursors - an affect which will be
discussed in the next sub-section. In \cite{zhang_development_2009-1} a steady
state neutronics and coupled thermalhydraulics code, which includes convective
fluid motion in the neutron flux, is used to show in figure 
\ref{axial_velocity_flux}
, axially, and in figure \ref{radial_velocity_flux}, radially, how a greater fluid flow
 velocity supresses the fast, $\phi_{1}$, and thermal, $\phi_{2}$, neutron fluxes. This affect is
 attributed to a larger loss of delayed neutron precursors outside of the core \cite{zhang_development_2009-1}.
  The reactor model
 utliized in \cite{zhang_development_2009-1} consists of an axially symetric
 open core type reactor with an outer graphite reflector. In the analyses which
 produced figures \ref{axial_velocity_flux} and \ref{radial_velocity_flux} the
 out of core residence time for the fuel was held constant despite a changing
 fluid flow velocity.
