\begin{abstract}
Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs)
of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting 
with a
resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing
number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs;
a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work
first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in the light of current
research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general
it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors ( DNPs ) through
the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low
reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as
a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron
flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible.
 An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics
is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux
 systems using
representative codes from each of the main modelling categories. Comparisons
between methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or non-use
in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general it is recommended
that time-resolved, multi-group neutron diffusion ( MGD ) approaches be used to
establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics ( PRK ) based
approaches which themselves may not be applicable for all modelling situations.
In such cases it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK
based approaches can not. Finally, a
review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an
evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting
turbulent diffusion in open core type circulating fuel reactors ( CFRs ) is a
poor assumption which leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the
delayed neutron fraction. Additionally it is seen that exclusion of secondary
heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and
troughs.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
A circulating fuel reactor (CFR) is any reactor in which fuel is ``circulated
 through the reactor and then the heat exchanger" \cite{ergen_1954}.
 Typically, CFRs have one of three sub-types: a fluid-fueled molten salt reactor
 (MSR) in which a fuel salt, typically a fluoride or chloride, is dissolved
 in a molten coolant salt, an aqueous homogeneous reactor (AHR) in which
 a fuel salt, typically a nitrate or sulfate, is dissolved in water, or a
 liquid metal fueled reactor (LMFR) in which a liquid metal containing the fuel
 isotopes is used in the core of the reactor.
 For the most part, this work will focus on MSRs rather than AHRs or LMFRs. However,
 when possible, the term CFR will be used when statements are more broadly
 applicable to any reactor with circulating fuel.
\par The history of MSRs began with the Aircraft Reactor Experiment at Oak Ridge National
 Laboratory (ORNL) in the late 1950s and grew with the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
 (MSRE), which was successfully operated, with a full power of 8 MWth, for more than 13,000
 equivalent full-power hours with \ce{^{235}U}, \ce{^{233}U}, and \ce{^{239}Pu} fuels at different
 points in time. No other MSR has been built since the MSRE project was closed
 in the late 1960s. However, MSR studies continued at ORNL, including the Molten Salt Breeder
 Reactor (MSBR) and the Denatured Molten Salt Reactor (DMSR), and elsewhere in the world. In
 general, there was very little interest in
 developing MSRs from the 1970s through the 1990s. This
 changed in the late 1990s, as interest in CFRs began growing in Europe. This momentum
grew with the MOST project and continued through ALISIA, EVOL, and now SAMOFAR, resulting in
the pre-conceptual Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). The Molten Salt Actinide
Recycler and Transmuter (MOSART) design from Russia, the Chinese-designed
Liquid Fueled Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (LFTMSR), the
FUJI series of reactors out of Japan, and a host of proposed privately designed
reactors have all additionally driven demand for
modeling and simulation of CFRs. 
\par Modeling CFRs proves to be a challenging task, even with today's
large selection of reactor simulation tools. This difficulty arises due to
the many differences between CFRs and solid fuel reactors, which have received the
majority of global attention. These differences include a liquid fuel
 which flows in the core of CFRs, natural processes which remove specific elements from
 the liquid fuel (e.g. gaseous fission products coming out of solution)
and the ability to perform online reprocessing and refueling of the liquid fuel.
 This first unique aspect, a flowing fuel, forms the focal point of this work and the
 works reviewed. Kinetics modelling, which allows for predicting
a reactor's response in time scales typically less than a few hours, is a key
requirement to any reactor design effort. Kinetics modeling is challenging in CFRs
because of their flowing fuel. In a solid fuel reactor, delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) 
born during fission are typically treated as a time-lagged source of neutrons.
In CFRs, DNPs are displaced from their originating position, which is 
often in locations 
of high neutronic importance. They move throughout the reactor's primary loop,
decaying in places of varying degrees of
neutronic importance, even outside the core region.
\par Approaches for capturing DNP movement in CFR kinetics codes 
range from solving the 
time-resolved multi-group neutron diffusion (MGD) equations with advective and
diffusive terms for fluid motion included on the DNP balance equations
all the way to adding
source and sink terms to point reactor kinetics (PRK) equations to account
for out-of-core decay of DNPs. Considering the tight interplay between the
fluid motion and the neutronic behavior in a CFR, many CFR kinetics approaches
include coupling neutronics calculations, loosely or tightly, 
with thermohydraulics simulations. This paper presents a review and discussion of the
unique physical phenomena tied to CFR kinetics modeling in Section 2. Section 3 contains
an extended discussion of the various proposed models for CFR
kinetics analysis along with sample transient simulations for
both fast and thermal systems using representative codes from each main
simulation method group. Following that, recommendations are then made in Section 4 regarding
which models, or combinations of models, might be best suited to 
work-flows for modelling various transients.
 Section 5 discusses common assumptions and their effects on CFR
kinetics modelling, before conclusions being drawn in Section 6.

\section{Physics of Circulating Fuel} \label{sec:physics}
In comparison to solid fuel reactors, CFRs exhibit unique
physics that affect many aspects of reactor kinetics. The subsections below 
describe some of the key phenomena unique to CFRs.

\subsection{Neutron flux} \label{ssec:flux}
While the speed of neutrons is many orders of magnitude greater than
the flow velocity of the fluid fuel in CFRs, the neutron flux can still experience
perturbations due to this fluid velocity field. These perturbations are 
second-order effects related to changes in fluid temperature and distributions of
 DNPs, as described below. In \cite{zhang_development_2009-1}
 a steady-state neutronics and coupled thermohydraulics code, which includes convective
fluid motion in the neutron flux, is used to investigate the effects of fluid
flow on various quantities of interest related to CFRs such as fast and thermal
neutron flux and DNP concentration profiles. 
Figure \ref{fig:zhang_2d_flux} shows that the
distribution of the neutron flux (thermal is shown but the conclusions for 
the fast flux are the same) is not significantly shifted in the direction
of the fluid flow. However, Figure \ref{fig:zhang_axial_velocity_flux} and
Figure \ref{fig:zhang_radial_velocity_flux} show how a greater fluid flow
 velocity ($U_{in}$) suppresses the magnitude of the fast
 ($\phi_{1}$) and thermal ($\phi_{2}$) neutron fluxes. This effect is
 attributed to a larger transport of DNPs outside
 the core \cite{zhang_development_2009-1}. The reactor model
 used in \cite{zhang_development_2009-1} consists of an axially symmetric
 open core type reactor with an outer graphite reflector. These analyses held the
 out-of-core residence time for the fuel constant, despite a changing
 fluid flow velocity.

    velocity and a 10 s out-of-core residence time; no units were provided with the flux.}

               values are taken at the center of the core.}
   \label{fig:zhang_radial_velocity_flux}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DNP distribution} \label{ssec:dnpd}
In contrast to solid fuel reactors where DNPs decay
 very close to the positions in which they were born, DNPs in CFRs are displaced
 from their originating positions by fluid flow effects, whether advective or
 diffusive. Furthermore, considering that the transit time through the entire
 core and flow loop system of many proposed CFRs is comparable to the decay
 constants of the longer DNP groups, a significant fraction of these DNPs can be
expected to decay outside of the core region and thus emit their neutrons in areas
of low or zero neutronic importance. The effective delayed neutron fraction in the
 core, $\beta_{eff}$, is reduced in this situation. In the \ce{^{235}U}-fueled MSRE,
 the flow-induced reduction in $\beta_{eff}$ at zero power was 212 pcm \cite{delpech_benchmark_2003}.

\par Not only do fluid flow effects displace DNPs from their originating positions,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dulla_msre_dnp_displacement}, these effects also
reduce the neutronic importance of DNPs, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:dulla_msre_dnp_importance}. This phenomenon is difficult
for PRK based approaches to capture. This importance reduction is due to two
effects: DNP decay out of core and in-core DNP decays in regions of low
importance. In Figure \ref{fig:dulla_msre_dnp_displacement}, the peaks in DNP
distribution seen at the lower and upper axial regions of the reactor are
due to fluid fuel holdup in the lower and upper plena respectively.
In \cite{dulla_models_2005}, a multi-group
diffusion scheme modeling the MSRE was used to produce the results shown
in Figures
\ref{fig:dulla_msre_dnp_displacement} and \ref{fig:dulla_msre_dnp_importance}.
The effects on DNP distributions, from \cite{zhang_development_2009-1}, caused
by varying flow velocity while holding out-of-core residence time constant are
shown, axially, in Figures \ref{fig:zhang_axial_velocity_dnp_1} and 
\ref{fig:zhang_axial_velocity_dnp_2} and, radially, in Figures
\ref{fig:zhang_radial_velocity_dnp_1} and \ref{fig:zhang_radial_velocity_dnp_2}.
The DNP groups with longer half-lives are most affected because the
fluid flow has sufficient time to displace them before they decay. For all
affected groups a higher fluid velocity reduces DNP group
concentration in the core, and there are more DNPs being moved out of the
 core, where they
eventually decay. In Figure \ref{fig:yamamoto_transit_time},
 while holding fluid flow velocity constant, the effect of
out-of-core residence time on DNP group concentration
in core is shown. With increasing primary loop transit time,
the concentration
of DNP groups in the core decreases as more DNPs decay out of the core.
The necessity to track DNPs out-of-core is an aspect of CFR kinetics
modelling that increases the computational cost of
MGD approaches as the size of the model is larger than just the
core of the reactor.

    multi-group diffusion approach. A higher C group number indicates

\end{figure}

\subsection{$\beta_{eff}$} \label{ssec:beta}
{\color{red}Before addressing the effects on $\beta_{eff}$ due to fuel circulation the 
deffinition of $\beta_{eff}$ in circulating systems should be established.
In \cite{dulla_models_2005} an extensive derivation of $\beta_{eff}$ and many
other neutronics parameters in the presence of a circulating fuel is presented. A condensced portion of this derivation is given in equations \ref{eq:X} through
\ref{eq:Y}. The arrived upon definition of $\beta_{eff}$ and the expression
for $\beta_{eff}^{i}$ is given by equations \ref{eq:W} and \ref{eq:Z}.
    
}
Just as DNP concentrations in-core are reduced by fuel flow, so too is their
contribution to the effective delayed neutron fraction, $\beta_{eff}$. An
expression for which can be seen in equation \ref{eq:beta_eff} while an
expression for the component groups, $\beta_{eff}^{i}$ is seen in equation
\ref{eq:betta_eff_i}.
Table \ref{tbl:mattioda_beta_reduction} shows 
that $\beta_{eff}$ is reduced both by a higher fluid flow velocity and
by a longer out-of-core residence time.

\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Value of $\beta_{eff}^{flow}/\beta_{eff}^{static}$ given out of
        core residence time, $\tau_{l}$, in seconds, 
        and fluid flow velocity, $v_{fluid}$ in [cm/s]. Data taken from
        the last two rows of table 5
        in \cite{mattioda_effective_2000}. A 1D reactor model with height of 3 m
        modeled while a 3 group neutron diffusion approach is used to generate
        the given data.} 
    \label{tbl:mattioda_beta_reduction}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            $\tau_{l}\rightarrow$ & 0 & 5 & 10 & 15 \\
            \hline
            $v_{fluid} = 60$ & 0.843 & 0.539 & 0.468 & 0.440 \\
            \hline
            $v_{fluid} = 100$ & 0.834 & 0.420 & 0.352 & 0.329 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

However,
this reduction in $\beta_{eff}$ does not act equally upon all DNP groups. Table
\ref{tbl:dulla_flow_regimes_beta} shows that, regardless of the flow regime chosen,
the reactivity contribution of longer half-life DNP groups is
reduced more than that of shorter half-life DNP groups. In the case of uniform
\footnote{In \cite{dulla_interactions_2007} the term ``slug flow" is used to
indicate a uniform fluid velocity profile - not a liquid-vapor mixture with
large pockets of vapor seperated by ``slugs" of liquid as the term is commonly
used to mean. For clarity the less amibiguous term ``uniform" is used in this
paper when referring to fluid velocity profiles termmed ``slug flow" in the
aforementioned work.}
in a MOSART-like system, the longest lived DNP group experiences a 68\%
reduction in reactivity contribution, while the shortest lived DNP group
experiences less than a 1\% reduction. These effects are driven by the increased
chance a long-lived DNP has of being swept into the primary loop before it can
decay in core whereas a short-lived DNP is much more likely to decay in-core
before it even has the chance to leave.

\subsection{$k_{eff}$} \label{ssec:keff}
Given the reactivity reduction associated with increased fluid flow
velocity in CFRs, it would follow
that there would be a commensurate reduction in the multiplication factor of
the system. This is certainly the case as the neutron multiplication factor
of a CFR is reduced by an amount given a fluid flow condition
when compared against the multiplication factor for the static fuel case.
This steady state reduction is easily accounted for in steady state
criticality codes by adding a pre-calculated reactivity
reduction to the reported criticality value. It may be expected
that the multiplication factor of a given CFR would continue to decrease
given an increasing flow rate. 
However, Figure \ref{fig:zhang_velocity_keff} shows that the
multiplication factor of the system described in \cite{zhang_development_2009-1}
increases with increasing flow velocity in the presence of a fixed inlet
temperature and out-of-core
residence time. \cite{zhang_development_2009-1} attributes
this phenomenon to increased cooling of the core, given the higher fluid flow 
velocity, as well as subsequent Doppler reactivity feedback with this effect
having a greater reactivity contribution than the increased loss of DNPs.
Figure \ref{fig:zhang_residence_time_keff} shows 
the expected reduction of $k_{eff}$ with increasing out-of-core residence time
while holding inflow velocity and inlet temperature constant. 
Figures \ref{fig:zhang_velocity_keff} and
\ref{fig:zhang_residence_time_keff} together show that the
effects of fluid fuel circulation on the multiplication factor
of a CFR are primarily related to the time DNPs spend out of
the core and to the thermal effects associated with increased
fluid flow velocity.

\section{Models} \label{sec:models}
As seen in Section \ref{sec:physics}, the neutronic behavior of CFRs is tightly
coupled to the thermohydraulics of the overall system because the reactivity 
contribution of DNPs is strongly influenced by fluid flow conditions.
This presents unique
challenges to traditional methods for reactor kinetics modeling, particularly
point-kinetics approaches which assume a constant value for $\beta_{eff}$. In
response to these challenges, three dominant approaches have arisen: 
fluid-flow-velocity field coupled multi-group, time-resolved, neutron diffusion;
new point reactor kinetics schemes; and quasi-statics; generally all coupled, tightly
or loosely, to a thermohydraulics solver. Recently,
\cite{laureau_coupled_2015} proposed a new method based upon a modified
fission matrix approach using Monte Carlo simulations feeding into
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Tables \ref{tbl:codes1}
through \ref{tbl:codes5} detail
the various implementations of these approaches throughout literature.
In the following subsections
each approach is introduced, along with two transient simulations: the pump-start
experiment for the MSRE representing a thermal system and an unprotected loss
of flow (ULOF) transient in the proposed MSFR representing a fast system. 
The effects of the fluid flow velocity on the DNPs in each
system have noticeable differences due to the channel type flow found in many
thermal systems and the typically unstructured flow found in many fast
systems.
It should be noted that the use of a particular code as an example of an
approach does not single that code out as being better than its peers; codes
were selected as examples based on both the quality and detail of the selected
transient as it was presented in the code's debut paper as well as
a desire for breadth in the number of codes covered.
 The suitability of any given code to any given task
is a determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account
computational costs, user-input requirements, and the nature of the transients
to be modelled. Details pertaining
to a code used for a transient example may be found in Tables \ref{tbl:codes1}
through \ref{tbl:codes5} as
well as the relevant literature.
\par The pump start-up transient for the MSRE offers a wealth of experimental data for code validation.
The transient occurs at zero power. The fuel is initially molten and
stationary, the fuel's fluid flow velocity is brought to its nominal value in
10 s by the pump start-up, and then the removal of control rods was used to
compensate for the increasing loss of DNPs from the core. However, 
unlike the instantaneous control rod movement assumed in many codes, 
the control rods in the
MSRE were speed limited \cite{krepel_dyn3d-msr_2007}. It is this inserted
reactivity, or the amount of removal of the control rods, that the codes simulating
this transient attempt to match.

\subsection{Multi-group diffusion} \label{ssec:mgd}
In terms of fidelity, within the modelling approaches considered for this
work, MGD based approaches 
make the fewest assumptions and simplifications out of any of the models.
This increases their computational cost, however, making these methods
the most computationally expensive of all the approaches considered.
In turn, this makes MGD based
approaches poor candidates for tasks involving large number of transient
simulations, such as parametric safety analysis and parametric design space
analysis. In Table \ref{tbl:mgd} a selected group of MGD based computational
tools which exhibit desirable characteristics is presented.
\par MGD allows for the direct incorporation
of fluid flow effects on both the neutron flux and the DNP concentration as
seen in Equation \ref{eq:mgd} and \ref{eq:mgd_dnp}.
This includes advective effects, the second term in the neutron flux equation 
 and the first term in the DNP distribution equation, and diffusive effects on
 the DNP distribution, the second term in equation \ref{eq:mgd_dnp}.
 In Equation \ref{eq:mgd_dnp}
 $Sc_{T}$ is the turbulent Schmidt number and $\nu_{T}$ is the eddy viscosity. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mgd}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{v_{g}} \cdot \frac{\partial \phi_{g}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot
    (\phi_{g} \overset{\rightharpoonup}u) = & \nabla \cdot D_{g} \nabla \phi_{g}
    + \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \prime \not= g} \Sigma_{s,g \prime \rightarrow g}
    \phi_{g \prime} + (1-\beta)\chi_{p,g}
    \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \prime = 1}^{G}\frac{1}{k_{eff}}
    (\nu \Sigma_{f})_{g \prime}\phi_{g\prime}\\ &+ 
    \mathlarger{\sum}_{i = 1}^{I}\chi_{d,g}\lambda_{i}C_{i} 
     - \Sigma_{a,g}\phi_{g} - \mathlarger{\sum}_{g \prime \not= g} 
    \Sigma_{s,g \rightarrow g \prime} \phi_{g} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mgd_dnp}
\nabla \cdot (C_{i} \overset{\rightharpoonup}u) - 
    \nabla \cdot \frac{\nu_{T}}{Sc_{T}}\nabla C_{i}
    = \beta_{i} \mathlarger{\sum}_{g = 1}^{G} \frac{1}{k_{eff}} 
    (\nu \Sigma_{f})_{g} \phi_{g} - \lambda_{i} C_{i}

\subsubsection{Thermal system} \label{sssec:mgd_ts}
Representing MGD approaches for the evaluation of thermal systems, the DYN3D-MSR
code from \cite{krepel_dyn3d-msr_2007} is chosen. While DYN3D-MSR is
capable of modelling DNP distributions in 3D, 
the radial DNP distribution is assumed to be constant
due to the MSRE's channel guided flow. \cite{krepel_dyn3d-msr_2007} 
The results of the DYN3D-MSR model of the MSRE pump start-up transient,
along with the experimental values and those obtained using a similar 1D code
(DYN1D-MSR) are presented in Figure \ref{fig:krepel_dyn3d_msre_pump_start}.
For many of the codes used in the
MOST project benchmark \cite{delpech_benchmark_2003}, both the original data used
by ORNL and the JEFF2.2 library were used to generate the DNP data. The most
immediate takeaway is that when using the JEFF2.2 libraries, both DYN3D-MSR and
DYN1D-MSR are able to closely match the experimental values, though they appear to
miss the reactivity oscillations later in the transient.

\begin{figure}[H]

   \caption{Figure 9 from \cite{krepel_dyn3d-msr_2007} showing both the experimental MSRE data
   and the simulated data from the DYN1D and DYN3D codes, using both the JEF and ORNL DNP data, for

   by the control rod motion used to keep the MSRE at a steady state power level.} 
   \label{fig:krepel_dyn3d_msre_pump_start}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fast system} \label{sssec:mgd_fs}
An unnamed code
from Politecnico di Milano (Polimi) \cite{fiorina_modelling_2014} is chosen here to represent
MGD approaches for the evaluation of fast systems.
In the implementation of the ULOF transient for
the MSFR \cite{fiorina_modelling_2014}, no flows are tracked other than the primary
loop flow. This will affect the outcome of the transient simulation, as discussed in
Section \ref{sec:asm}. The pumps in the primary loop are assumed to
coast down exponentially with a time constant of 5 seconds. The simulated transient is
seen in Figure \ref{fig:fiorina_msfr_ulof} along with the results from another
code from the Technical University of Delft (TUDelft) which has an unknown relation to
the code from \cite{kophazi_development_2009} though both use a
modified version of DALTON as the neutronics solver. 

\begin{figure}[H]

   response of the MSFR during a ULOF transient as simulated by the Polimi and TUDelft codes.} 
   \label{fig:fiorina_msfr_ulof}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Point reactor kinetics} \label{ssec:prk}
Point reactor kinetics (PRK) is arguably the most well known and most widespread
method for modelling the kinetics of multiplying systems. Traditionally,the PRK
method has used a fixed value for $\beta_{eff}$ and precursor concentration
equations, Equations \ref{eq:prk} and \ref{eq:prk_dnp}, 
that do not allow for moving precursors.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:prk}
    \frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \frac{\rho(t) - \beta_{eff}}{\Lambda} n(t) +
     \sum_{i = 1}^{I} \lambda_{i} C_{i}(t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:prk_dnp}
    \frac{dC_{i}(t)}{dt} = \frac{\beta_{eff}^{i}}{\Lambda} n(t) -
        \lambda_{i} C_{i}(t)
\end{equation}

While these assumptions would not seem to connect well
with the physics of CFRs, their approximation is not far off from the
predictions of more rigorous models for transients occurring at higher
reactor powers where thermal reactivity feedbacks are strongest.
This is well illustrated by Figures
\ref{fig:zhang_prk_flow}, \ref{fig:zhang_prk_temp}, and 
\ref{fig:zhang_prk_reac};
the transient depicted is a ULOF transient in a MOSART-like reactor with the
flow being reduced to 4\% of its nominal value in 7 seconds from the start
of the transient \cite{zhang_comparison_2009}. In these figures,
``SM" refers to the SIMMER-III code \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005};
``MPM" refers to a delayed PRK model discussed in Section \ref{sssec:dpk} \cite{suzuki_reactivity-initiated-accident_2008};
and ``PM0" and ``PM1" refer to traditional PRK models, with PM0 using an
uncorrected $\beta_{eff}$ and PM1 using a corrected $\beta_{eff}$ taken from
the first time-step of the SM method. It is unknown if the subsequent
$\beta_{eff}^{i}$s were adjusted commensurately with the overall $\beta_{eff}$.
PM1 represents a subclass of PRK methods referred to in this paper as
``corrected point kinetics" (CPK) that uses a one-time (flow dependent) adjusted $\beta_{eff}$ to account for
displacement of DNPs.
The differences between these methods and other 
PRK based methods will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:comp}.
While PM0 overshot and PM1 undershot the power and temperature peak values, and
both undershot the final value for the fuel salt temperature, both methods
predicted the same evolution of the transient as the other more detailed
methods.

In the following
sections, various PRK based methods will be discussed. 
While different researchers
tend to implement each method in slightly different ways, methods are

tools that exhibit desirable characteristics.

\subsubsection{Decay point reactor kinetics} \label{sssec:dpk}
In this paper,
decay point reactor kinetics (DPK) are those implementations
which aim to account for the movement of DNPs through source and sink terms
in the DNP concentration equation, as seen in Equation \ref{eq:dpk_dnp}
where $\tau_{c}$ is the fuel residence time in the core, and $\tau_{l}$ is the
fuel residence time in the primary loop.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dpk_dnp}
    \frac{dC_{i}(t)}{dt} = \frac{\beta_{eff}^{i}}{\Lambda} n(t) -
        \lambda_{i} C_{i}(t) - \frac{C_{i}(t)}{\tau_{c}} +
        \frac{C_{i}(t - \tau_{l}) e^{-\lambda_{i} \tau_{l}}}{\tau_{c}}
\end{equation}

In addition to approximating the loss of DNPs from the core due to fluid
flow effects, all DPK implementations presented in this paper include
a bias reactivity subtracted from the numerator in the first right-hand-side
term of Equation \ref{eq:prk}, or a one-time corrected $\beta_{eff}$ to account
for the reduction of the contribution of DNPs to neutron multiplication in
going from a static fuel to a flowing fuel.

\par \textit{Thermal System:} Representing DPK approaches for the evaluation of thermal
systems is a modified version of RELAP5 from \cite{shi_development_2016} in
which both the reactor kinetics and thermohydraulics modules were modified
to better model CFRs. Figure \ref{fig:shi_msre_ps} 
shows the MSRE pump start transient as evaluated by this code.
The model underestimated
the reactivity peak and the trailing reactivity tail but captured the
overall behavior of the transient, which is consistent with the
general behavior of PRK approaches.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Shi_Development_2016_Fig_3}
   \caption{Figure 3 from \cite{shi_development_2016} showing 
    compensative control rod reactivity inserted during the MSRE pump start
   transient; both measured, and simulated with a modified RELAP5 code.} 
   \label{fig:shi_msre_ps}
\end{figure}

\par \textit{Fast System:} Representing DPK approaches for the evaluation of fast
systems is a DPK implementation from \cite{guerrieri_investigation_2013}
modelling the ULOF transient in the MSFR. The evolution of this transient is
seen in Figure \ref{fig:guerrieri_msfr_ulof}. The primary pumps are
assumed to coast down exponentially with a time constant of 2 seconds to 5\%
 of their nominal flow, as natural circulation cannot be modeled in the set-up 
from \cite{guerrieri_investigation_2013}. In Figure 
\ref{fig:guerrieri_msfr_ulof}, 
``EQL" refers to the equilibrium fuel composition of the
MSFR, while the various ``BOL" indicators refer to postulated beginning of life (BOL) fuel
compositions for the MSFR.

   response to a ULOF transient under differing BOL scenarios as well as the
   expected equilibrium condition of the reactor.} 
   \label{fig:guerrieri_msfr_ulof}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{``I" point kinetics} \label{sssec:spk}
``IPK", the term used in \cite{merle-lucotte_physical_2015},
are those PRK based methods developed to address the
movement of DNPs through the use of a moving mesh. In
\cite{merle-lucotte_physical_2015}, a fixed mesh over the system geometry
is used on which parameters
such as reactivity and fission power are calculated, while a ``moving" mesh is
used to track DNPs and the temperature of the flowing fluid. The two
meshes exchange information to update one another with the moving mesh advancing
its cells in space according to the flow characteristics of the system.
Details of the method and
the governing equations can be found in \cite{merle-lucotte_physical_2015}.
\par \textit{Thermal system:} No published examples of the IPK method being used
to analyze transients in a thermal system were found. This does not
necessarily indicate, however, that IPK is ill-suited for thermal CFR
analysis.
\par \textit{Fast system:} The results of two simulated extracted power transients
in the MSFR are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lucotte_ipk}. 
In each transient the extracted power on the secondary side is changed by
50\%, one less and one more, and each is simulated with the IPK method and with a
standard PRK method using a flow-informed corrected $\beta_{eff}$. 
The IPK method seems to predict
reactivity oscillations during the transient while the
corrected PRK method results do not oscillate but do capture the
overall behavior of the transients. These features highlight two important aspects
of traditional PRK
based approaches: how they fail to capture DNP circulation effects and 
how, with a correction for the baseline reactivity lost by having a flowing fuel,
they can predict the final outcomes of transients involving
circulating DNPs. Again it is illustrated how the choice of a modelling method
depends on the information needed from the model. If peak values are needed,
traditional PRK based approaches are inadequate for the task. If overall behavior
and end-states are required, PRK based approaches may be entirely adequate.

   response to instantaneous variations of the extracted power.} 
   \label{fig:lucotte_ipk}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Modified point kinetics} \label{sssec:mpk}
In this paper,
modified point reactor kinetics (MPK) are implementations
using a PRK model derived in the presence of fuel motion
and weighted with a given weighting function. A complete derivation of such a
model using the adjoint flux and adjoint delayed-neutron-emissivities can be
found in the literature \cite{dulla_models_2005}.
\par \textit{Thermal system:} Figure 
\ref{fig:dulla_4x_flow} shows a simulated flow-induced transient in the MSRE
in which the fluid flow velocity is increased by a factor
of four beginning at nominal power.
In Figure \ref{fig:dulla_4x_flow} ``standard pk (a)" refers
to a DPK model in which the parameters have been adjoint weighted without fuel
flow, ``standard pk (b)" refers to a DPK model in which the parameters have
been adjoint weighted with fuel flow, ``reformulated pk" refers to the re-derived
point kinetics model found in \cite{dulla_models_2005}, and ``reference" refers
to an MGD solution. The most noticeable features of this figure are how poorly the
DPK approaches capture the transient and how even the reformulated MPK approach
fails to capture the reactivity oscillations from DNP circulation. The
MPK  approach does show the expected behavior for PRK based approaches in that
it misses the maximums and minimums but captures the overall behavior of the
transient. The DPK approaches fail as the transient is driven by spatial effects
arising from a change in flow rate. The updated $\beta$ values in the DPK equations
are unable to account for previous values of $\beta$.
\par \textit{Fast system:} No published examples of an MPK based approach being used
to analyze transients in a fast system were found. This does not
necessarily indicate, however, that MPK based approaches are ill-suited for fast
CFR analysis.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Quasi-statics} \label{ssec:qs}
Quasi-statics represents an attempt to
reach a compromise between MGD and the various implementations of PRK. While
MGD uses many fewer approximations than PRK and is more capable of 
capturing shape or flow-dependent transients and transients occurring
at low power,
it is much more computationally intensive than PRK. In quasi-static
implementations, three of which are mentioned in Tables \ref{tbl:codes1}
through \ref{tbl:codes5} and specifically highlighted in
Table \ref{tbl:qs},
computational cost savings are sought while striving to maintain the accuracy
of the solution. This is accomplished by updating the PRK parameters 
periodically throughout the simulation
by running a full MGD calculation of the system at the corresponding points
in time. In this manner, changes in the flux shape and DNP distribution can
be caught in greater detail and used to update the PRK method, which then 
simulates the transient until the next MGD update.
\par The time at which these updates occur is key to the computational
 cost savings of
quasi-statics. As observed elsewhere such as in \cite{dulla_models_2005}, transients that induce
large shape perturbations on the flux will likely require many more MGD
updates. Without an adaptive
updating scheme, the requirement of frequent shape updates through an MGD
calculation can strongly reduce the computational savings offered by
quasi-statics. See Appendix \ref{app:tools} for an explanation of this table 
and Tables \ref{tbl:codes1} through \ref{tbl:codes5} for more details.

\subsubsection{Thermal system} \label{sssec:qs_therm}
Representing quasi-static approaches for the evaluation of thermal systems
is the modified SIMMER-III code \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005}.
The PRK scheme, termed separable point kinetics (SPK) in this
paper, is used in the SIMMER-III code. The DNPs are split into two types.
Static DNPs are represented by Equation \ref{eq:spk_static} in which $N$ is the
neutron
population amount, $\beta$ is the delayed neutron fraction, $F$ is the fission
source operator, and $\Psi(x,t)$ is the neutron flux shape function.
Movable DNPs are represented by
Equation \ref{eq:spk_move}. A unifying equation, Equation \ref{eq:spk_uni},
links the two aforementioned equations.
Additional details can be found elsewhere in \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005}. The transient
seen in Figure \ref{fig:wang_msre_ps} is the same MSRE pump start transient
described above. Whether or not the deviations from the
experimental values seen in Figure \ref{fig:wang_msre_ps} are due to the
shortcomings of the PRK portions of the quasi-static scheme employed or are
simply the result of computational error limitations is unknown. 
However, the quasi-static scheme employed captured
both the overall behavior of the transient as well as some aspects of the
reactivity oscillations.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:spk_static}
    \frac{\partial C_{s}(x,t)}{\partial t} = N \beta F \Psi(x,t) -
        \lambda C_{s}(x,t)
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:spk_move}
    \frac{\partial C_{m}(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \nabla (u(x,t) C_{s}(x,t)) -
        \lambda C_{m}(x,t) - \nabla(u(x,t) C_{m}(x,t))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:spk_uni}
    C(x,t) = C_{s}(x,t) + C_{m}(x,t)
\end{equation}

   \caption{Figure 7 from \cite{wang_development_2003} showing the experimental and simulated
   response of the MSRE to the pump start-up and pump coast down transients.
   While \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005} has a more complete description of how
   SIMMER-III handles DNPs, \cite{wang_development_2003} has a higher quality
   figure of the same transients using the same code and so it is used here
   rather than the figure from \cite{rineiski_kinetics_2005}.} 
   \label{fig:wang_msre_ps}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fast system} \label{sssec:qs_fast}
No published examples of a quasi-static scheme employed to analyze a fast
CFR system were found. This fact does not necessarily indicate, however, that
quasi-statics are ill-suited for fast CFR kinetics analysis.

\subsection{Fission matrix}
Typically, fission matrices are considered to be tools to accelerate the fission
source convergence in Monte Carlo codes. However,  
a method has been proposed and demonstrated that uses
fission matrices as the neutronic driver in a transient simulation \cite{laureau_coupled_2015}. While a
replication and explanation of the derivation for this method is beyond the
scope of this work, the underlying principle is to pre-compute the necessary
fission matrices for a given transient through a steady state Monte Carlo
simulation. These matrices are then passed into a CFD code that uses them
to update the neutron flux and power distribution in the modeled system. At
this time, no published data exists concerning the computational cost
of such an approach. In Figure \ref{fig:laureau_msfr}, a 300 pcm reactivity
insertion transient in the MSFR can be seen as modeled by this new approach. The
slight bump in power seen at about 1 second is due to DNP-rich fuel salt
re-circulation from the initial power spike. While no published transients
involving a 300 pcm reactivity insertion in the MSFR could be found to compare
against Figure \ref{fig:laureau_msfr}, the method used appears to
capture some aspect of the DNP recirculation behavior typical of all CFR
transients.

   the MSFR to an instantaneous insertion of 300 pcm worth of reactivity.}

\end{figure}

\section{Comparisons of the Various Kinetics Methods}
\label{sec:comp}
In terms of suitability for the kinetics analyses of CFRs there should be no
question that time-resolved MGD approaches, those including appropriate treatment
for the DNPs and coupling to a thermohydraulics code, will
produce transient simulations with the highest degree of accuracy among the
approaches presented so far. However, this high degree of accuracy does not
make MGD based approaches the best approaches to use in all situations.
MGD based
approaches suffer from high computational costs and a general complexity of
user-input. This, in turn, makes MGD based approaches ill-suited to tasks
requiring a large number of transient simulations such as parametric safety
analysis and parametric design space analysis.
For situations in which computational speed is necessary and the shortcomings
of PRK based approaches are unacceptable, quasi-statics based approaches
show simulation capability comparable to MGD approaches as seen in
Figure \ref{fig:wang_msre_ps}, while promising at
least modest computational cost savings. \cite{dulla_models_2005} showcases
a variety of transients in a critical and sub-critical MSRE configuration with
differing numbers of shape recalculations in the quasi-static scheme presented 
all while providing relative computational costs as compared to the MGD method
also employed in the same work. In Figure \ref{fig:dulla_4x_qs} the same factor
of four increase in flow velocity transient as described in Section
\ref{sssec:mpk} is modeled with the quasi-static scheme from
\cite{dulla_models_2005} using differing numbers of shape, or MGD,
recalculations, noted by ``k". Table \ref{tbl:dulla_costs}
reports relative computational costs, as compared to
MGD, for the quasi-static method using different numbers of shape recalculations.


\begin{figure}[H]

   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Dulla_Models_2005_Fig_2_18}
   \caption{Figure 2.18 from \cite{dulla_models_2005} showing different results of the

   \label{fig:dulla_4x_qs}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{From table 2.VI in \cite{dulla_models_2005}. Computational cost
        of the quasi-static method with differing numbers of shape
        recalculations relative to the MGD method.}
    \label{tbl:dulla_costs}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \# shape recalculations & 1 & 2 & 10 & 50 & 100 & 1000 & MGD \\
            \hline
            relative time & 0.001 & 0.024 & 0.172 & 0.458 & 0.822 & 1.102 &
                1.000 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

It is evident that while quasi-statics based approaches can save computational
 cost with some
degree of lost accuracy, they can actually cost more than
a full MGD simulation if implemented poorly.
\par For situations in which a high degree of simulation accuracy is not needed,
PRK based approaches offer a computationally inexpensive means with which to
simulate transients in CFRs, at least those transients which do not occur at
low powers or involve strong spatial effects, such as significant changes in
fluid fuel circulation rate.
Figures \ref{fig:zhang_prk_flow}, \ref{fig:zhang_prk_temp}, and 
\ref{fig:zhang_prk_reac} illustrate how PM0 and PM1
compare to DPK and quasi-static models when modelling a ULOF in
the MOSART reactor. PM1 has a decreased $\beta_{eff}$ and lack of correction
for flow effects, so it predicts a faster decrease in power, a lower
peak averaged fuel salt temperature, and generally lower reactivity
contributions from both DNPs and temperature feedback mechanisms. These
effects are attributable to the lower fraction of delayed neutrons present
in the PM1 model. With a lower fraction from the outset of the transient, there
is a lower positive reactivity introduction in the earlier parts of the
transient from DNPs that would have been built up in higher numbers during
a time of higher reactor power; ultimately leading to a lower power peak.
On the other hand, the PM0 model has almost
the opposite behavior, which can largely be attributed to its having the
highest fraction of delayed neutrons of all the models; its $\beta_{eff}$
has no accounting for flow-induced effects on DNPs. The larger
$\beta_{eff}$ in the PM0 model leads to increased reactivity introduction
in the beginning of the transient, as more DNPs are able to decay.
\par While PM0 and PM1 bound the other two methods, an additional observation
 from
these same figures is the closeness of the performance of the DPK and
quasi-static models. They both predict similar transient
behaviors and outcomes. The peak temperature they each predict is effectively
the same, with DPK splitting the difference in the final averaged fuel salt
temperature between SM and the PM methods roughly in half. Displaying
a similar trend of precision relative to more detailed methods, the DPK method
 used to produce
the transient simulation seen in Figure \ref{fig:guerrieri_msfr_ulof}
produces similar transient
behavior as seen from the MGD method in Figure \ref{fig:fiorina_msfr_ulof} 
despite the two
studies using differing pump coast down time constants.
\par DPK methods may effectively capture transient evolutions at power and
 with a loss
of flow, but as shown in Figure \ref{fig:shi_msre_ps} they may fail to
adequately capture reactivity oscillations in transients occurring at low
or zero power
and with increases in flow rate. In general, PRK methods struggle to capture
transients with strong spatial effects, including flow variations 
\cite{dulla_models_2005}. Figure \ref{fig:dulla_4x_flow} backs this statement
up well and lends further backing to the issues experienced when using
 PRK methods 
to capture flow-induced DNP reactivity oscillations. The DNP methods fail
to capture the behavior of the transient, entirely missing the reactivity
reduction caused by the increase in flow. Even the MPK method shown
\cite{dulla_models_2005}, while capturing the overall direction of the
transient, fails to capture the strong oscillations in power caused by
re-circulation of DNP bearing fuel salt. The IPK method, on the other hand,
seems to capture DNP-induced reactivity oscillations well, even at nominal
power levels. While Figure \ref{fig:lucotte_ipk} shows the oscillations that
can be captured using the
IPK method at higher reactor powers, because of scale effects
it misses the more dramatic oscillations that IPK captures at the low power
version of the same transient. These oscillations can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:lucotte_ipk_reac} where the extracted power reduction transient shows
even greater reactivity oscillations than the mirror transient with increased
power extraction. As was observed elsewhere in the literature 
\cite{zanetti_development_2016}, DNP re-circulation effects impact
transient behavior more at lower powers.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Merle_Lucotte_Physical_2015_Fig_3_Top}
   \caption{Figure 3 (top) from \cite{merle-lucotte_physical_2015} showing the simulated
   MSFR response to an instantaneous change in the extracted power.} 
   \label{fig:lucotte_ipk_reac}
\end{figure}

\par Overall, more studies are required of the methods for modeling CFR
kinetics to establish the power ranges and transient
types in which the various PRK approaches sufficiently capture the reactor
 behavior for a given design.
Considering the high computational cost of MGD codes and the likelihood 
that even the most rigorous PRK approaches will fail
to capture
specific transient responses of interest, the implementation of time-adaptive
quasi-static schemes into system codes may prove necessary for completion of tasks
of a parametric nature. This will enable future
risk-informed transient analysis of CFRs in which many hundreds to thousands
of transient calculations will be needed to be run. In the mean time, MGD
approaches will likely be the first method that any investigation into CFR kinetics
should turn to, from which an appropriate quasi-static or PRK method can be
compared to and accepted for use. Table \ref{tbl:select_codes} summarizes a selected group
of computational tools exhibiting desirable characteristics and implementing
a range of approaches. See Appendix \ref{app:tools} for an explanation of this table and

\section{Assumptions} \label{sec:asm}
While the choice of a particular model to simulate CFR kinetics brings
with it a set of benefits and limitations beyond the choice of a modeling
method, the selection and use of specific assumptions can have an
impact on the kinetics evaluation. In the following subsections, the
impact of certain assumptions on transient behavior will be discussed. These
assumptions will be broken down into two main groups; those that affect 
modelling of the DNP distributions, and those that affect the thermohydraulics
modeling of a system.

\subsection{DNP-related assumptions} \label{ssec:dnp_asm}
One of the most notable assumptions
that the body of work examined in this paper collectively supports is the
avoidance of 1D flow models for tracking DNPs in open core fast systems.
Tables \ref{tbl:codes1} through \ref{tbl:codes5}
 show that while many evaluations performed
for channel type thermal systems used 1D, axial approximations of the DNP
flow, no such 1D approximation was made for an open core type fast system.
Indeed, even the widely used 2D, rotationally symmetric models used for many
fast systems have been called into question, 
motivating efforts
to create a full 3D code \cite{aufiero_development_2014}. Concerning the effects of 1D versus 3D modelling
of DNPs in channel type CFRs, no works were found
which modeled both the DNP distributions in 3D and the thermohydraulics of
the system in question. Overall, more studies are needed to investigate the
impact, both in channel type and open cores, of reduced dimensionality
modeling with particular attention to the flux and DNP distribution treatment.
\par In many CFRs, particularly open core fast systems, the fuel salt flow is
turbulent in nature. In these systems, DNPs are not only displaced by the
bulk movement of the fluid, but may also be affected by turbulent diffusion.
Figure \ref{fig:cheng_diffusion} shows some perturbations of the DNP
distribution for the fourth group of DNPs when including turbulent diffusion
in the DNP modeling for the MOSART reactor.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Cheng_Development_2014_Fig_19}
   \caption{Figure 19 from \cite{cheng_development_2014} showing the DNP
   concentration in a
   hypothetical MSR core with thermal power of 2.4 GW, inflow fluid flow
   velocity of 0.5
   $\frac{m}{s}$, and residence time out-of-core of 3.94 s. Dimensions are 
   given elsewhere in \cite{cheng_development_2014}.
   The left image shows the fourth
   DNP group concentration in-core without any fluid flow effects. The center
   image
   includes advective flow, and the right image includes both advective flow and
   turbulent diffusion.} 
   \label{fig:cheng_diffusion}
\end{figure}

Turbulent diffusion is typically modeled by inclusion of the second term in
Equation \ref{eq:mgd_dnp}. However, 
very little data exists on turbulent mass transport in many common
CFR fuel fluids \cite{aufiero_calculating_2014}, mostly molten fluoride or chloride salts. This leaves the
actual value of $Sc_{T}$ quite uncertain. Figure \ref{fig:aufiero_sc}
shows a parametric analysis of the impact of the
turbulent Schmidt number on $\beta_{eff}$ for the MSFR. 
Over 2 orders of magnitude for $Sc_{T}$, the changes in
$\beta_{eff}$ only
affected reactivity by about 20 pcm.
Another phenomenon that can affect DNP distributions
is molecular diffusion; however, independent studies 
\cite{aufiero_calculating_2014} and \cite{cheng_development_2014} agree that 
molecular diffusion effects can be ignored because they are so much smaller
than turbulent diffusion and advective flow effects on DNP distributions.

\subsection{Thermohydraulics-related assumptions} \label{th_asm}
Just as there is a choice of assumptions to be made with respect to the
modelling of DNP distributions in CFRs, there are choices to be
made with respect to the modelling of the thermohydraulics. One of the most
common assumptions made in many of the works examined in this paper is 
a uniform profile for the fluid velocity profile in the channel-type CFRs. This is a
particularly common assumption for those approaches which do not explicitly
model the fuel salt flow in the core but rather ignore thermohydraulics
all together or employ an energy balance to account for temperature effects
on reactivity. An exhaustive evaluation
of this assumption, as compared with other flow profiles, may be found in \cite{dulla_interactions_2007}.
The power evolution through an average fluid velocity change, the profile for which
is found
in the upper right-hand corner, can be seen in Figure 
\ref{fig:dulla_flow_regimes}. Figure \ref{fig:dulla_flow_regimes}
shows that the power evolution for this transient is 
influenced by the flow regime assumed. The effect of differing flow regimes
on $\beta_{eff}$ and $\beta_{eff}^{i}$ in the MSRE can be seen in Table
\ref{tbl:dulla_flow_regimes_beta}. The flow regimes referred to in Figure
\ref{fig:dulla_flow_regimes} and Table \ref{tbl:dulla_flow_regimes_beta} are
best 
summarized by Figures \ref{fig:dulla_flow_map} and \ref{fig:dulla_flow_adf}.

\par While not addressing any specific assumption, a related question surfaces:
what impact does the inclusion of a secondary loop
have on CFR transient modelling? With respect to channel type CFRs
(e.g., MSRE), this question can be directly answered 
\cite{zanetti_development_2016}. Figures \ref{fig:zanetti_sec_1mw},
\ref{fig:zanetti_sec_5mw}, and \ref{fig:zanetti_sec_8mw} 
depict reactivity insertion
transients in the MSRE at 1 MW, 5 MW, and 8 MW operating power, respectively,
with reactivity insertions of 24 pcm, 19 pcm, and 13 pcm,
respectively. In all three transients, inclusion of the secondary loop
increases the power peak and decreases the power minimum. Thus,
when modeling CFR transients, exclusion of additional heat transfer
loops is not a conservative assumption and leads to less accurate simulation
results.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
This paper summarizes and assesses the key physical phenomenon affected
by fluid fuel flow in CFRs, with specific emphasis on the effects on reactor
kinetics from fluid fuel flow effects on the DNP distribution. Current models and
codes used for CFR kinetics calculations are reviewed, with results for sample 
transients provided for
fast and thermal systems as produced by representative codes from each major
modelling group. While MGD models offer the best accuracy of the
approaches reviewed, PRK models can also
produce results with varying degrees of resemblance to
those produced by MGD approaches. Quasi-static methods are additionally 
reviewed and, when implemented so as to play to their strengths, show promise
as a compromise between the accuracy of the MGD models and the speed of the PRK
models. A novel fission matrix based approach to kinetics modelling in CFRs is
also presented, though further study is required before determinations can be
made. Lastly, a few shared assumptions and their validity are investigated.
\par More work is needed to assess the differences between 2D 
rotationally symmetric models for open core type systems and more robust 3D
approaches. Furthermore, the differences between various flow regimes assumed
in channel-type reactors are found to have non-negligible impacts on kinetics
analysis and transient modeling, indicating that at least loose coupling with
a thermohydraulics code may greatly improve the performance of kinetics models
for CFRs currently employing the uniform flow assumption for their velocity field.
\par Of the approaches reviewed for 
kinetics analysis in CFRs, it is recommended that MGD approaches be used
to establish the range of transients in which PRK based approaches can produce
acceptable transient simulation results for similar reactor designs.
For transients which lie outside the
abilities of PRK approaches, quasi-static schemes with time-adaptive
stepping appaear to offer promising reductions in 
computational cost while enabling reasonably accurate parametric analyses of reactor operational
and safety characteristics in CFRs.
This, however, would require a
user-friendly, time-adaptive, and general-purpose quasi-static code that does not currently exist. It is 
thus recommended that the academic community, perhaps in partnership with
government labs and private organizations, create such a high quality quasi-static
based code. This code would ideally be reactor agnostic, supporting a wide range of  
CFR geometries and design features. It should utilize more than one PRK based approach with the IPK based approach as an
option, be open source, be written in a modern coding language (e.g. C++), 
be well documented, be verified against existing MGD approaches, and
be validated against available MSRE operational data.

\section{Computational Tools} \label{app:tools}
Tables \ref{tbl:codes1} through \ref{tbl:codes5}
 summarize numerous computational
tools for modeling CFR kinetics 
found in the literature and dated later than 1990. Tools are listed by the
work in which they were found. If tools were mentioned in multiple works, then
the work that appeared to provide the most information about their development
is considered
the primary work, with others listed in the ``Used In" row. The ``Author" and ``Year"
rows included in some tables reference the first author and the publishing year
of the reference given in the ``Reference" row. In these tables the ``TH Eqs"
row indicates whether or not the computational tool solves
equations for the mass and energy and momentum transfer for the working fluid in
the given system. The
``Reactor Analyzed" row indicates reactor design(s) modeled in
the primary work. The ``General Reactor Input" row indicates, to the best
of the authors' knowledge, if the computational tool has a generic modeling
capability or if it is reactor specific; tools that in theory could be used for
any reactor but do not have a general meshing tool are not considered generic.
The ``Precursor Treatment" row specifies methods used to
treat the precursor drift; whether that was a variant of the PRK models
or 1D axial or 2D r-z, or 3D full flow modelling of the DNP movement. For
quasi-static based tools, two entires are given for the ``Precursor Treatment".
The first is for the MGD based portion of the scheme while the second is for the
PRK based portion of the scheme.
The ``Precursor Diffusion" row indicates if turbulent diffusion was included in
modeling the DNP distributing.
The ``N. Method" row indicates the computational method used to model
kinetics. The ``N. Dimension" row indicates the spatial dimension of 
the neutronics method while the ``N. Energy Dim." row indicates the energy
discritization used.
The ``Xs(T)" row indicates any treatment used to account for temperature
effects on nuclear cross sections, and specifies the type of treatment if known.
The ``TH X Eq" rows indicate whether or not an equation governing ``X" thermalhydraulic
phenomenon was
included in the kinetics modelling.
The ``Turbulence Treatment" row 
indicates which model, if any, was used for modelling turbulent flow in the
thermohydraulics model; this is not related to the ``Precursor Diffusion." row.
The ``Density Treatment" row indicates what treatment, if any, was used for the
density term in the TH equations. The ``Spatial Discretization" and ``Time
Discretization" rows indicate what type of discritization scheme was
used for each variable, if any. The ``Validation" row indicates any known
verification
or validation efforts taken for the given tool. An ``MSRE" entry indicates
that a simulation of an MSRE experiment was compared to the actual experimental
data, while a ``Benchmark-MSRE" entry indicates that the respective tool was
evaluated by the European MOST project, with validation efforts best
summarized by \cite{delpech_benchmark_2003}.
